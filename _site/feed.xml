You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-code-camp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&quot;&gt;Free Code Camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favourite for learning full stack web development. They offer a great front and back end curriculum that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the lessons. As a bonus, at the end of the curriculum you will have a few impressive projects under your belt for your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;codecademy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, but they even offer a course on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploy-a-website&quot;&gt;how to deploy a Jekyll site&lt;/a&gt;. If you are completely new to Jekyll, I would recommend working through that course as a great start for learning how to deploy your Jekyll site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;khan-academy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great resource not only for learning mathematics (what most people probably know Khan Academy for), but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming&quot;&gt;computer programming&lt;/a&gt;. What Khan Academy offers that is different from the other two above resources is that it offers courses in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science&quot;&gt;computer science related&lt;/a&gt; topics, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms&quot;&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography&quot;&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;. This is unique in that most online resources mostly focus on the programming side of things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Le</name></author><category term="documentation" /><category term="sample" /><summary type="html">The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program.
