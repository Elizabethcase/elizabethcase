**About Me**

I'm a scientist, educator, and writer. I am completing my PhD at Columbia University in Polar Geophysics. I use radar to study how snow turns into ice. I'm also the co-founder of [Cycle for Science](www.cycleforscience.org), an adventure-based science outreach program that trains scientists to translate their research into hands-on lessons that they bring by bicycle to students across the US and around the world. I have writing in Scientific American about the Juneau Icefield Research Program [1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/warming-arctic-on-thin-ice/) [2](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/its-melting-science-on-ice/), [State of the Planet](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2019/10/07/bicycle-tour-hudson-valley-glacier/), and others.
