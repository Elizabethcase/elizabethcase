Hello! I'm Elizabeth Case. I'm a scientist, writer, and educator. Currently I'm working on my PhD at Columbia University and the Lamont-Dohety Earth Observatory. I'm the co-founder of [Cycle for Science](www.cycleforscience.org). I have been published in Scientific American (see [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/warming-arctic-on-thin-ice/) and [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/its-melting-science-on-ice/), the [State of the Planet](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2019/10/07/bicycle-tour-hudson-valley-glacier/), and more.
