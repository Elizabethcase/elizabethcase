## Glitch Art

I glitch photos of places undergoing rapid climate change and/or ecosystem collapse, like Alaskan glaciers and coastal communities. My code, along with a jupyter notebook, is available [here](https://github.com/Elizabethcase/glitch/blob/master/Glitch%20the%20Climate.ipynb)

This work was chosen for the [2019 Creative Climate Awards](https://www.humanimpactsinstitute.org/cca-2019) and shown at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in 2019.

## Firn Cores

![Cyanotypes of cores](https://github.com/Elizabethcase/elizabethcase.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/hannah_aquifer_art.png?raw=true)

While working as a member of the research faculty on the Juneau Icefield, I hand-drilled some firn cores to look at how the density of firn (old, compressed snow) changes with depth. I worked with Hannah Mode on to try to visually record the density using cyanotypes. A write up of the work with images can be [found here](http://www.hannahpmode.com/recent-work#/aquifer/).
