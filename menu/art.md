I glitch photos of places undergoing rapid climate change and/or ecosystem collapse, like Alaskan glaciers. My code, along with a jupyter notebook, is available [here](https://github.com/Elizabethcase/glitch/blob/master/Glitch%20the%20Climate.ipynb)

This work was chosen for the [2019 Creative Climate Awards](https://www.humanimpactsinstitute.org/cca-2019) and shown at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in 2019.
