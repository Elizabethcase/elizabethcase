## Main question: Why is water apparently leaking through an impermeable ice lens?

![[ice_lens_leak.png]]
*Figure 1: Demonstration, see panels 1 and 2 - saturation in panel 2 decreases once rainwater boundary condition goes to zero; ice lens only because to thicken after aquifer has drained (but from what water?)*

## Main questions

Steps taken:

- Where is the water going?
	- water is disappearing (not being refrozen, not obviously draining anywhere else) -> W below lens doesn't increase 
- Does this happen at any saturated -> unsaturated bound or only where $\phi=0$?


Main questions
1. What is the intended indexing for vars (fluxes, cell states, velocities)?
	1. Is that the indexing that has been executed?
2. 




That means that JavaScript solutions, although often superior to pure CSS, are out of scope for this project and will not be used.<label for="mn-1" class="margin-toggle"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">testing marginnote</span> Also out of scope are handling printed versions of web pages and integration with static site generators or other formats. Thankfully, all these useful applications can be well served by separate work that builds on top of Tufte CSS.
