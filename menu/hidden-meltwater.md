## Main question: Why is water apparently leaking through an impermeable ice lens?

![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elizabethcase/elizabethcase.github.io/master/assets/img/ice_lens_leak_annotated.png)
*Figure 1: Demonstration, see panels 1 and 2 - saturation in panel 2 decreases once rainwater boundary condition goes to zero; ice lens only begins to thicken after all fully saturated cells drain below S=1.

## Attempts to fix





- Where is the water going?
	- water disappears until no cell is fully saturated (not being refrozen, not obviously draining anywhere else) -> W below lens doesn't increase 
- Does this happen at any saturated -> unsaturated bound or only where $\phi=0$?


Main questions
1. What is the intended indexing for vars (fluxes, cell states, velocities)?
	1. Is that the indexing that has been executed?
2.
