Hello! I'm Elizabeth Case. I'm a scientist, writer, and educator. Currently I'm working on my PhD at Columbia University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. I'm the co-founder of [Cycle for Science](www.cycleforscience.org). I have been published in Scientific American, the State of the Planet, and more.
