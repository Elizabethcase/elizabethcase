An expanse of coarse sand that serves up a distinct first impression of "toxic wasteland" or "nuclear storage site", the [West Greenwich Sand Dunes](https://www.google.com/maps?q=west+greenwich+sand+dunes&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjxuNSrssvtAhVouVkKHTDbAk0Q_AUoAXoECBUQAw) transport you and your family to the post-apocalypse. In other words, the perfect place to go for a walk in 2020!

There is an official entrance and parking lot, but I and a few others chose to park on a turnoff off Hopkins Hill Road. I recommend this approach because it drops you right out on top of the eastern set of dunes. Big signs warn that hunter orange is required. Approximately two of the eight people and one of the three dogs I saw were wearing orange.

A short (20 feet) wooded path opens up into the sandy expanse. The other set of dunes, due west from where I'm sanding, are oddly geometric -- flat on top, with step sides. A dusting of snow lingered in striped patterns on the ground; the small undulations left by dirt bikes and ATVs providing just enough change in aspect to protect the snow from the late-afternoon sun. 

I wandered south across the eastern dunes, until I reached the tallest one. With an imagined yell, I sprinted down it, arms swinging wildly, feet kicking up dust, almost floating, losing control of my self and releasing the rage and resignation of this pandemic year. The flat bottom comes up quickly, but any further away and the sprint may have turned into a tumble. 

At the base of the dune, a fire pit and stones piled into the shape of the letter S. I turned around and trudged back up the sand. I recommend this sisyphean approach: a reckless sprint down, a lolling climb up. The first time is the hardest, then your feet slowly carve in stair steps: our past selves setting up the success of our future dreams.

Warm enough to shed my jacket, I set my sites on the western dunes. To get there, you cross a borderland of sandy expanse, then reach the knife-edge of a scraggly grassland with three roads cutting through it. Left, middle, right? I choose what's right in front of me, so head down the middle road, green grass poking through the tire treds, Keds sucking the wet mud.

Then, after an interminable amount of time, dazed and glazed, I make it to the other edge of the grassland. Ahead, a black shape on the sand that looks like the wreckage of a [WavyGuy](https://www.wavyguys.com/). I squint and approach. I have a weird vision that it's a large snake, coiled and anticipatory. The mirage clears into three charcoaled logs. 

Maybe because they are shaded, but these dunes don't provide the same pleasure even though they are taller. I walk up one hesitating at a piece of pink quartz, though the place feels unnatural enough that I leave the stone on the mountain. At the top, I find the steepest point, and charge down. I'm ready to head for home.
